        <p>Deshaun Watson continues to move the Houston Texans offense and show his fantasy worth, this time against the Cleveland Browns. Throwing 31 pass attempts, completing 16 for 225 yards and three Touchdowns and interception, as well as again showing his dual threat with another 23 yards on the ground.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>Watson started the season as a backup, and then became the starter for the Texans, going into his bye week he looks to be a great fantasy option. Pick him up where you can, or target him after week 8 and his touch matchup with the Seahawks</p>
